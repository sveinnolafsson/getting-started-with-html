<h1>Short overview of stage 0</h1><br>
<h2>Reminder of the building blocks of the Internet, as in the protocols and how do they work;</h2>
<ul>
<li>what is a server</li>
<li>what does a browser do</li>
<li>Internet protocol </li>
<li>hypertext protocol</li>
</ul>
A web page is a document written in Hypertext markup language. A browser fetches information from a server and feeds them through a browser as a web page. <br>
Code is instructions made by a programmer in a language (code) that a computer can understand and execute.<br>
Computers are stupid in the way that if you donâ€™t tell them in the exact correct way what to do (correct syntax) they will not execute. With the correct syntax, on the other hand, you can make them do some pretty amazing things.<br>

Do not try to memorise everything, look it up when you need to.<br><br>

<h2>HTML tags:</h2><br>
An open-ended (void) tag like the img src tag do not need an ending tag and a block tag like element will need one. Most tags have an opening and a closing tag.<br>
An attribute is the property of a tag.<br>
